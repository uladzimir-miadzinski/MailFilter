# Mail Filter by Uladzimir Miadzinski for WoW 3.3.5a

This addon is useful when you want to filter incoming mails (spam) in WoW 3.3.5a.

It is pretty simple and at `v0.0.1` it can be configured only by slash commands

Mail Filter slash commands:
* `/mf` - this helper menu in-game.
* `/mf_reset` - reset addon to default values.
* `/mf_ignore_sender` - to add one more sender to ignore. 
  * Example: `/mf_ignore_sender Goldseller`
* `/mf_ignore_heading` - to add one more heading to ignore.
  * Example: `/mf_ignore_heading WTS Gold`
* `/mf_clear_senders` - to clear senders ignore list.
* `/mf_clear_headings` - to clear headings ignore list.
* `/mf_show_headings` - show currently ignored headings.
* `/mf_show_senders` - show currently ignored senders.

All addon data stored inside `WTF/ACCOUNT_NAME/SavedVariables/MailFilter.lua`. You can edit it manually.

Feel free to use it - it has no legal limitations.
